## Project 1: WCA Competitor Growth

#### [Final Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/WCACompetitorGrowth/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

I created visualizations of how the competitor base of [World Cube Association](wca.link) (WCA) has grown over time. The final dashboard showcases 4 elements:
- The number of competitions sanctioned by the WCA each year
- The continuous growth in the number of distinct competitors that attended WCA competitions
- When was the first WCA competition in each country
- How many distinct competitors have competed in each country

The map visualizes how the WCA has expanded into new parts of the world. The charts show an exponential growth in the number of competitors and competitions, as well as the huge impact the COVID-19 pandemic had.

I've used two tables from the WCA database export (https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/misc/export.html):
- Competitions: 1 row for every competition, with information about the competition, such as the date and country
- Results: Includes every competitor's all competition results. This table was used to gain information about how many people attended each competition.
