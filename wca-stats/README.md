# WCA data analysis
A collection of statistics I've queried from the WCA database (see downloadable database versions [here](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/wiki/Developer-database-export)). Files include:

- 'fastest-filling-competitions.sql': A script to calculate which competitions reached their competitor limit in the fastest time after registration had opened.
- 'miscellaneous.sql': A collection of fairly small SQL queries mostly written to answer requests in the WCA Statistics Facebook group
- 'update-db.py': A Python script to download/update a local copy of the WCA database (importing the file to MySQL has to be done separately)
- '333_single_quartile_progression.ipynb' and 'wca-competitor-growth.sql': explained [here](https://tnorr.github.io/portfolio/projects/wca-growth.html)
- 'sum_of_ranks.py' A Python script for calculating competition sum of ranks
